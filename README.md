# Milestones Covered:
Data Preprocessing: Jupyter Notebook is excellent for cleaning, tokenizing, and preparing datasets, ensuring this milestone is well underway.

Model Training: You're well-equipped to fine-tune generative AI models within Jupyter Notebook, meeting this milestone effectively.

Real-Time Extraction: While the notebook can simulate extractions, implementing transfer learning and validating results may require scaling the solution beyond the notebook, such as using frameworks or APIs for deployment.
